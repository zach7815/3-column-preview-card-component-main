## My process

This time I took a different approach from my last couple of times and programmed the site for mobile screens first and then used media queries change the layout for desktop screens. I found I needed to use less media queries doing this process and the overall process of getting the design right was a lot easier.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I learnt and reinforced my skills in using flexbox. I learnt the advantages of programming the site for mobiles first and then using media queries for desktop sites.

### Continued development

I think the next project to help me learn should be a bit more complex, something that uses grid to help with the layout, and then start introducing javascript into the projects that I program.

### Useful resources

- [Centering objects in CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-objects-using-css/) - This helped me remind me how to center an object when I was struggling to.
